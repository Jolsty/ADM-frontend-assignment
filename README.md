# React Template

Hello World template that runs on React 18, Webpack 5, Babel, ESLint, Prettier and Tailwind 3. It also includes the Montserrat font, just because I like it.

# Notes

This is a React template (for anyone that doesn't want to use CRA).

It was developed and tested on `node (16.14.2)` with `npm (8.5.0)`.

If you start a repository from this template, you should remember to change package.json metadata according to your needs.

# How to run

`npm i` to install all dependencies.

`npm run start` to start a local development server.

`npm run build` to build a production application.

# Vanilla version

`git checkout master`
